# JavaCryptosystem
In our proposed cryptosystem we will use AES-128-CTR to provide Confidentiality and HMACSHA256 to provide Authenticity and Integrity.Ideally we would have used AES-256 but the basic installation of Java only allows up 128. We chose CTR mode of AES-128 so we would not have to worry about padding.
